NMPC strategy for Autonomous Racing of Scale Vehicles
=======================================================

This repository is an extension of the [F1TENTH simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator). Such a simulator mirrors the behavior of an autonomous racing scale vehicle. The repository is endowed with the necessary files to run the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy described in the paper whose references are given below

If you are using this simulator for research purposes especially for your publication, please take a look at the [Publications page](https://github.com/vittoriocataffo/A-Nonlinear-Model-Predictive-Control-Strategy-for-Autonomous-Racing-of-Scale-Vehicles/wiki/Publications). 

The contribution can be also considered as a reference guide for expanding the [F1TENTH simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator) functionalities by facilitating the integration of the new control algorithms and functionalities.

Some simple case studies are considered to evaluate the performance of the retrieve controller. Further instruction on how to execute them are reported in the following. The code is released under Apache license, thus making it available for scientific and educational activities.

The platform was developed using Ubuntu 18.04 and the Melodic Morenia version of ROS, but it is also fully compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 along with the Noetic Ninjemys distribution of ROS. Although backwards compatibility is guarantee, i.e., the platform is fully compatible with Melodic Morenia version of ROS and Ubuntu 18.04, such configuration is not recommended since the ROS support is expected to be closed in April 2023.

Below there are the instructions necessary for getting started. 

Installation Instructions - Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11
========================================================================

To use the code developed and stored in this repository some preliminary actions are needed. They are listed below.

1. Install and initialize ROS Melodic desktop full, additional ROS packages, catkin-tools, and wstool:

```
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
$ sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-control-toolbox
$ sudo apt install python3-vcstool python3-catkin-tools protobuf-compiler libgoogle-glog-dev
$ sudo apt install python3 python

$ cd ~/autosim_ws
```

4. Build your workspace with `python_catkin_tools` (therefore you need `python_catkin_tools`)

```
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i

```
$ echo "source ~/autosim_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

OpEn Framework
===============

Before you start, you need to install the OpEn framework and its requirements.

1. **Rust**, following the official [installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
- Why? The Rust compiler is an essential component of OpEn; you will most likely not need to write (or compile yourself) any Rust code, but OpEn's Python/MATLAB interface will need the compiler to build your optimizer
- How? Follow the [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install); in a nutshell, on Linux and MacOSX run:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

and add `/.cargo/bin` to your path - e.g., on Linux, put the following line in your `~/.profile` file:

```
# Add this to your ~/.profile file
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

then **logout and login again** (or restart) for this to take effect.

- **clang**, following this [guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/blob/master/book/src/requirements.md). Why? OpEn uses CasADi to build certain functions in C, which then need to be called from OpEn's core solver in Rust. For that purpose we need **bindgen**, which requires **clang**.

2. Python Interface

As simple as `pip install opengen`. You might need to prepend `sudo` on some Linux systems. Note that OpEn requires Python **version 3.5 or newer**. You might, therefore, need to install it using `pip3 install opengen`.

> OpEn may run on earlier versions of Python (as old as 2.7), but we cannot promise you that (the main difficulty being the installation of dependencies). In that case, it is strongly recommend that you use `virtualenv`. To install OpEn in a virtual environment, using `virtualenv`, you first need to create such an environment, then activate it, and lastly, install `opengen` as above using `pip`. That is, you need to run:
>
>```
>virtualenv -p python3.6 venv36
>source venv36/bin/activate
>pip install opengen
>```

3. Install opengen

Go into `optimization-engine/open-codegen` and create a virtual environment:

```
cd optimization-engine/open-codegen
virtualenv -p python3.6 venvopen
source venvopen/bin/activate
python setup.py install
```

You're ready to go! It's a good idea to use an IDE, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Use the above virtual environment (`venvopen`) in PyCharm:

- go to Run > Edit Configurations > Add new configuration
- Script path: specify `main.py`
- Working dir: `optimization-engine/open-codegen/opengen`
- Python interpreter: `venvopen`

Install OpEn in Rust is as easy as:

```
cd optimization-engine
cargo build
```

If you need to use `opengen` - the Python interface of OpEn - with a local version of the Rust library, use `with_open_version(local_path=...)` in your code. Read the [advanced options](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/python-advanced#build-options) for details.

Further info can be found at the [link](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation).
